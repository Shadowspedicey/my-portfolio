				<p className="text-white">Hey there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Ahmed. a Full-Stack Web Developer who loves crafting scalable systems that make an impact. I specialize in ASP.NET on the backend and React or Angular on the frontend, building solutions that are not only functional but secure, maintainable, and ready to grow.</p>
				<p>Iâ€™ve been in the programming world for about five years, and itâ€™s been a journey of curiosity and exploration. I started with game development in Unity, drawn to the creativity of bringing ideas to life. From there, I moved through frontend and mobile (Android) development before finding my real passion, backend engineering and system design.</p>
				<p>Now, I focus on designing clean, scalable applications using .NET, C#, and modern web frameworks, such as React and Angular, while also diving into data science and machine learning as part of my Computer and Data Sciences studies. I enjoy blending both worlds: writing clean, efficient code and designing systems that can handle real-world complexity.</p>
				<p>My biggest strength lies in system design and scalability, thinking ahead about how systems grow, how data flows, and how to keep them secure and reliable. I also value humor, curiosity, humility, and perspective, which make teamwork not just productive, but enjoyable.</p>
				<p>My mission is to help startups and businesses without an online presence step confidently into the digital world, building the right tools and platforms tailored to their needs.</p>
				<p>Whether itâ€™s joining a team or building something from scratch for a client, I approach every project with the same mindset: learn, build, and deliver excellence.</p>
